I’m a Master’s student in Civil Engineering at Colorado State University, specializing in hydrology and hydraulics. My work centers on understanding water systems in mountainous landscapes, with a focus on river restoration and post-wildfire hydrology. I’m passionate about exploring how climate change impacts these environments and developing management strategies to mitigate its effects.

I also enjoy creating tools that streamline workflows for earth scientists and river engineers, reducing manual tasks like aerial imagery classification and valley bottom delineation so they can focus on solving larger problems.

I have extensive experience working with geospatial data science, primarily using Python and R, and have developed skills in terrain analysis and drone-based Structure from Motion (SfM). You can explore more of my work under the [Projects] tab.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy reading, cooking, mountain biking, and spending time with my wife and surprisingly athletic tiny dog.
