Rivers don’t follow a straight path, and neither has my career. Driven by a desire to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises, I first worked in regenerative agriculture before shifting my focus to river science. River restoration captivates me because it’s inherently interdisciplinary—combining hydraulics, geomorphology, and ecology to develop solutions rooted in a deep understanding of river processes.

Today, my work spans fish passage design, post-wildfire erosion studies, and river restoration planning, all driven by a passion for understanding how landscapes evolve and how we can restore them. I love the mix of hands-on fieldwork and data-driven analysis—whether I’m wading into a stream to take measurements, flying a drone for topographic mapping, building a hydraulic model, or coding in Python and R to make sense of complex watershed dynamics.

I have extensive experience working with geospatial data science, primarily using Python and R, and have developed skills in terrain analysis and drone-based Structure from Motion (SfM). You can explore more of my work under the [Projects] tab.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy reading, cooking, mountain biking, and spending time with my wife and surprisingly athletic tiny dog.
